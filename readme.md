# What is this project?
This project is a homework project that I've got from the school as a personal work.  
It's a simple lottery game.  
The random number refreshes for every 0.2 seconds and when the computer got <space> input from the user, it immediately stops refreshing the numbers.  
The users will have 3 chances to play the game, and the total score will be recorded with the nickname of the player.  

After the game, the user can see the ranks, and it's sorted from the highest score.
